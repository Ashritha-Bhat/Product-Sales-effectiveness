FicZon business is majorly on the sales force effectiveness. As the market is maturing and more new competitors entering the market, FicZon is experiencing the dip in sales. Effectiveness sales in dependent on lead quality and as of now, this is based on manual categorization and highly depended on sales staff. Though there is a quality process, which continuously updates the lead categorization, it's value is in for post analysis, rather than a conersation.
